  <meta property="og:description" content="We’ve turned hipster. I have proof. Look: I will now tell you the story about our search for a plant. We went downtown where there’s artsy fartsy murals… And we bought a plant… The end. There’s a band that mentions Arizona sunsets in their song, probably because they look like this: At some point we went to see Lay Mizz (which is how everyone says it) with my bro and his bro (bro as in friend, except for the first one which is in reference to my brother from the same mother). This picture doesn’t do the height factor justice, but I was getting some vertigo when we first walked in. And yeah it was pretty fantastic. Not as depressing as I remember (I’ve only seen it once which was the most recent movie) I was woken up at around 2 or 3 am by lots of flashing lights outside and a helicopter circling around the neighborhood. It was quite irritating. Not as irritating as being murdered though, so I’m happy it wasn’t us who was murdered (I actually don’t know what the deal was). I started listening to the police scanner out of morbid curiosity since I wasn’t going to sleep with the giant mechanical bird in the sky, but really, police officers need to work on their pronunciation skills. I heard something about an apartment complex and a dude with corn rows though. To prove our true hipstership, we spent a couple days in Bisbee, AZ. My cousin was getting married near there, and it’s where my dad grew up so we jumped on the opportunity to take the tour from a local. First we stopped in Tombstone, which is a tourist trap, one which my dads family always made sure to drive on past. It’s pretty hokey indeed but hey, they make some delicious Saspirilla over there. Every building in Bisbee is at least half a century old with wood floors and all that. Here’s our hotel room at the Canyon Rose, which I highly recommend. The town is literally on the border of Mexico. My dad used to play around in the desert here as a kid, and there wasn’t this wall thingy there, so they had to make sure they didn’t wander too far and end up over the border. We went to an amazing Gelato shop where we watched some cartoons for a bit. And we went antique shopping. Damn it feels good to be a hipster Bisbee reminds me a bit of San Fransisco. There’s lots of weirdos everywhere and there roads are narrow and scary, and everything is old. Here’s the mine where my Grandpa worked, which shut down in the 70’s. And we saw a bunch of dust devils. How cliche, Arizona. You know, this is a good metaphor for life. Sometimes you can see something cool in the far off distance but right of front of you is a bunch of bug splatters. We should remember to focus on the cool view in the distance. Oh yeah we went to Weird Al concert. He played a bunch of his original songs (yes he has a lot of original songs). This is my view. This is Emily’s view. Oh look, we went to some other show. Ok bye">
