    <p>One time we decided to spend an entire Saturday in a magical far away land called Prescott, because it seems like a mysterious mystical town tucked away somewhere in the Arizona desert, and also we&rsquo;re looking for places to live that&rsquo;s not in the center of a giant metropolitan.</p>
<p><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_1936.jpg" alt="IMG_1936"> It was a pretty cool place, and we found some Super Cute Little Houses that probably aren&rsquo;t available because they&rsquo;re too small and cute, but we were still taking notes. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_2785.jpg" alt="IMG_2785"> And we got some delicious tacos -reason number 58 to move to Arizona: <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_5202.jpg" alt="IMG_5202"> Oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_6731.jpg" alt="IMG_6731"> Any place that uses an upside down &rsquo;e&rsquo; in the place of an &lsquo;a&rsquo; is fine by me. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_0449.jpg?w=8064" alt="IMG_0449.JPG"> <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_4141.jpg" alt="IMG_4141"> <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_6781.jpg" alt="IMG_6781"> Then I helped dig ditches for a service project at a church farm with beard man. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_7802.jpg" alt="IMG_7802"> <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/americangothic.jpg" alt="AmericanGothic.jpg"> Then the Tuskan Raiders got us. Type F to pay respects   F <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_71851.jpg" alt="IMG_7185"> Now to the portion of the blog that nobody cares about, but we had front row tickets to the Screaming Females in a dingy basement club underneath the skyscrapers of downtown Phoenix. It was amazing and I&rsquo;m officially a mega fan of this band. The crowd was fairly hipster which means it was less weirdos being weirdos and more bearded people with glasses. Hipsters are very timid and docile; there was a lot less jostling about than I&rsquo;m used but I guess I can live with not getting kicked in the head or something. I wish I could say more, but suffice it to say I&rsquo;m pissed off that this band plays dingy basement bars. The greatest band in the world, The Ramones played clubs for 20 years, so people just have bad taste. Have fun listening to Train or whatever. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/screamingfemales.gif" alt="screamingfemales.gif"> We were trying to get a picture of the sticker on Marissa&rsquo;s guitar which contained the imprint &ldquo;Keep Off Facebook&rdquo;. I knew I liked these people. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_8282.jpg" alt="IMG_8282"> If you want to know why I hate living next to a noisey freeway near a noisey airport, in the middle of college student land, where everyone has a loud fancy car (that their parents probably bought them), it&rsquo;s because this is where I grew up: <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_31521.jpg" alt="IMG_3152"> Trees are neat <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_2710.jpg" alt="IMG_2710"> <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_6039.jpg" alt="IMG_6039"> WOWZ a few more pictures like this and I&rsquo;ll have lots of friends! <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_6066.jpg" alt="IMG_6066"> My favorite hobby these days involves rummaging through stacks of vinyl records.
