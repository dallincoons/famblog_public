    <p>One time we decided to spend an entire Saturday in a magical far away land called Prescott, because it seems like a mysterious mystical town tucked away somewhere in the Arizona desert, and also we&rsquo;re looking for places to live that&rsquo;s not in the center of a giant metropolitan. <img alt="IMG_1936" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_1936.jpg"> It was a pretty cool place, and we found some Super Cute Little Houses that probably aren&rsquo;t available because they&rsquo;re too small and cute, but we were still taking notes. <img alt="IMG_2785" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_2785.jpg"> And we got some delicious tacos - reason number 58 to move to Arizona: <img alt="IMG_5202" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_5202.jpg"> Oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy <img alt="IMG_6731" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_6731.jpg"> Any place that uses an upside down &rsquo;e&rsquo; in the place of an &lsquo;a&rsquo; is fine by me. <img alt="IMG_0449.JPG" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_0449.jpg?w=8064"> <img alt="IMG_4141" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_4141.jpg"> <img alt="IMG_6781" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_6781.jpg"> Then I helped dig ditches for a service project at a church farm with beard man. <img alt="IMG_7802" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_7802.jpg"> <img alt="AmericanGothic.jpg" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/americangothic.jpg"> Then the Tuskan Raiders got us. Type F to pay respects   F <img alt="IMG_7185" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_71851.jpg"> Now to the portion of the blog that nobody cares about, but we had front row tickets to the Screaming Females in a dingy basement club underneath the skyscrapers of downtown Phoenix. It was amazing and I&rsquo;m officially a mega fan of this band. The crowd was fairly hipster which means it was less weirdos being weirdos and more bearded people with glasses. Hipsters are very timid and docile; there was a lot less jostling about than I&rsquo;m used but I guess I can live with not getting kicked in the head or something. I wish I could say more, but suffice it to say I&rsquo;m pissed off that this band plays dingy basement bars. The greatest band in the world, The Ramones played clubs for 20 years, so people just have bad taste. Have fun listening to Train or whatever. <img alt="screamingfemales.gif" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/screamingfemales.gif"> We were trying to get a picture of the sticker on Marissa&rsquo;s guitar which contained the imprint &ldquo;Keep Off Facebook&rdquo;. I knew I liked these people. <img alt="IMG_8282" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_8282.jpg"> If you want to know why I hate living next to a noisey freeway near a noisey airport, in the middle of college student land, where everyone has a loud fancy car (that their parents probably bought them), it&rsquo;s because this is where I grew up: <img alt="IMG_3152" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_31521.jpg"> Trees are neat <img alt="IMG_2710" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_2710.jpg"> <img alt="IMG_6039" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_6039.jpg"> WOWZ a few more pictures like this and I&rsquo;ll have lots of friends! <img alt="IMG_6066" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_6066.jpg"> My favorite hobby these days involves rummaging through stacks of vinyl records. That is all. <img alt="IMG_3024" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_3024.jpg"> Here I am conversing with our future overlords. It&rsquo;s all very exciting! <img alt="IMG_3146" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_3146.jpg"> Sex machine: <img alt="IMG_4537" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_4537.jpg"> We babysat our friends fishy <img alt="IMG_4893" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_4893.jpg"> We went to the grocery store and there was no ice cream so we threw ourselves on the ground and screamed. <img alt="IMG_5482" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_5482.jpg"> Emily went to something called Pinners Conference which has a lot classes to learn various things. <img alt="IMG_0160" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_0160.jpg"> <img alt="IMG_5031" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_5031.jpg"> Emily got to learn how to do water color painting. <img alt="IMG_4854" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_4854.jpg"> PONIES ARE EFFIN CUTE! <img alt="IMG_5962" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_5962.jpg"> Emily bought some flamboyant shoes to go clubbing with. <img alt="IMG_3195" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_3195.jpg"> Yeah people in Utah are homogonized and cookie cutter and yeah there&rsquo;s a major keeping-up-with-the-jones kind of attitude there, but we also really like not having mountains around: <img alt="IMG_9984" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_9984.jpg"> There&rsquo;s at least one good looking female in this picture <img alt="IMG_9188" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_9188.jpg"> Boo! <img alt="IMG_8399" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_8399.jpg?w=1526"> <img alt="zoom 6" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/zoom-6.jpg"> <img alt="zoom 7" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/zoom-7.jpg">     <img alt="IMG_7023" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_7023.jpg"><img alt="IMG_6670" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_6670.jpg"><img alt="IMG_4750" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_4750.jpg"><img alt="IMG_4167" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_4167.jpg"><img alt="IMG_3899" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_3899.jpg"><img alt="IMG_1088" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_1088.jpg"> <img alt="IMG_2345" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_2345.jpg"></p>
