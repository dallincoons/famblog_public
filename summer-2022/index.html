<p>We had one last hurrah with Jane and Mark&rsquo;s family before they headed off to Oklahoma. We tried to &lsquo;hold down the fort&rsquo; with the kids while they had a yard sale, and then went out for ice cream. We will miss having them close by.</p>

<p>Emily&rsquo;s dad participates in an event where (mostly Porsche) drivers see how quickly they can make it through a course. We took Kev to observe, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/img_3890.jpg?w=768" alt=""></p>
<p>One of the things we&rsquo;ve been doing to try to survive the loooong winter is to go to an arcade and play some of the games geared toward younger kids which Kev is still a little young for, but we give him some help. We spun a roulette will (teaching &rsquo;em young all about gambling), and ended up winning a big jackpot and we walked out with a bunch of goodies. We didn&rsquo;t spend all our points that first go around and have gone back a couple times since to play games and spend the rest of our points on cars, balls, candy and such.</p>

<p>We dedicated a three day weekend to potty learning. Our approach was stripping him down and paying very close attention so that we could catch him whenever he started leaking. We ended the weekend having successfully taught him to use the potty when he needed to pee. Poop was tougher and we spent the next several weeks having lots of accidents to clean up. But I think he&rsquo;s mostly got it down now.</p>

<p>Another long winter activity we&rsquo;ve tried is going to the aquarium. Kev has developed an interest in fish as a result, albeit a mild interest in comparison to cars and trucks.</p>
<p><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/img_0786.jpg?w=768" alt=""></p>
<p>We visited California to visit Emily&rsquo;s grandparents and spent some time at the beach which Kev was in love with, likely because of the endless supply of digging material. We also put him in a hole:</p>

<p><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/img_4080.jpg?w=768" alt=""></p>
<p>Back home, we were still able to find some prime digging sites.</p>
<p><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/img_4148.jpg?w=768" alt=""></p>
<p>We went to the pride thingy in Porter Park and Kev got some digging time in.</p>
<p><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/img_0896.jpg?w=768" alt=""></p>
<p>We went grocery shopping, and Kev found the trucks. It&rsquo;s all fun and games until he poops his pants. He seems to get very relaxed when in this mode and frequently results in a&hellip; gift for mom and dad.</p>
<p><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/img_4171.jpg?w=768" alt=""></p>
<p>Sometimes when mommy goes into Target to grab a few things we go find some cool trucks to admire.</p>

<p>This is June. I kept thinking one day it might get warm. It didn&rsquo;t; at least not until late June!</p>
<p><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/img_4212-1.jpg?w=768" alt=""></p>
<p>After late June when we could finally go outside without sweaters we have been trying to take full advantage. We discovered a cool spot called Cress Creek that has an easy enough hike that we can make a quick jaunt in the morning before Kev&rsquo;s nap.</p>

<p>Kev is starting to warm up to the splash pad, although the big bucket that dumps water still scares him so he&rsquo;s not in love with it.</p>
<p><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/splashpad.jpeg?w=240" alt=""></p>
<p>We enrolled him in swimming lessons. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s his favorite; it&rsquo;s been challenging and a little scary, but we&rsquo;re proud of him for continuing to do something challenging!</p>

<p>Before Janae and Mark left for Oklahoma, they gave us their grill and we&rsquo;ve been dabbling in a little bit of barbecue.</p>
