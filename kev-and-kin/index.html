    <p>We started feeding Kev solid foods, though it doesn&rsquo;t seem like much of it goes to the correct location. Still, it&rsquo;s good for him to practice, and at the very least it seems like he enjoys playing with all the interesting textures.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a video of him trying solid food for the first time. We now let him play with his food, which means he gets really messy and disgusting, and so we make sure to eat dinner right before bath time.</p>

<p>Dinner and a movie:</p>

<p>We tried to go to Yellowstone, and we saw the reports that it was going to rain, but we figured we could handle a little precipitation. I guess we missed the fact that it was going to be in the 30&rsquo;s F (2 degrees C, for people who use a system that makes sense). It rained the entire way, and then as we were approaching the entrance, the cotton flakes started falling from the sky. Seeing as we weren&rsquo;t very prepared to deal with snow, we weren&rsquo;t too keen on paying the entrance fee and testing out Kev&rsquo;s car seat longevity. We stared Mother Nature in the face, and we blinked first.</p>
<p>But we still parked the car at the entrance to a campsite and walked around the forest for a bit, and saw lots of interesting things, like pine needles.</p>

<p>We took Kev to California to visit his great grandparents. We were very nervous to take him on a two hour flight from Idaho Falls to San Diego. Was he going to scream the whole time, was he going to have a massive blowout? About an hour into the flight to California, he had long ceased to be amused, but mercifully Emily somehow got him to fall asleep.</p>

<p>We spent some good quality time with grandparents.</p>

<p>Sometimes it feels like he learns a new skill every day. For example, while we were in California he started to figure out how to use his legs to do this. Since then he&rsquo;s learned how to propel himself forward, so he&rsquo;s essentially crawling, or more accurately, working his way across the floor.</p>

<p>We took him to the beach, and the sensory overload was a little too overwhelming.</p>

<p>On the airplane trip back home, he slept again for a little bit, and flight was shorter than expected, thankfully. At one point in the flight, we started catching wiffs of something foul. It turns out Kev had a little surprise for us in his drawers. I had no idea how to change a baby in an airplane before the flight, and I still have no idea. I took him to the tiny little bathroom in the back of the plane and awkwardly tried to change him on the toilet seat while making sure he didn&rsquo;t fall while not getting poop everywhere. I guess that&rsquo;s probably a rite of passage. I&rsquo;m now officially a boring-as-hell parent!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really feel like talking much about myself this time, but suffice it to say that the job hunt is not going that great. I didn&rsquo;t pass my Amazon interview, but I think I got close, so I may try again in 6 months. It&rsquo;s not the greatest economic environment to be looking for a job, but there&rsquo;s still a lot to be grateful for. I have a cushy job which allows me to work from home and spend more time with the family, even though my pay was cut by 25%. We&rsquo;re still living below our means and saving a little bit of cash, and we&rsquo;re debt freeeeee! (that never gets old)</p>
