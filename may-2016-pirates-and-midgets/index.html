    <p>Well we moved to a new place YET AGAIN. Why? Cause we get bored, that&rsquo;s why. And I wanted to be closer to work I guess. Yes we successfully moved to Tempe, which is the city next door to Phoenix. Tempe is a poop dump. Well not really, but there&rsquo;s a lot of college students. That&rsquo;s it, I&rsquo;m flossing.  I had to go to the dentist to get some teeth filled. My mom&rsquo;s enamel sucks and seems like I inherited it. Going to the dentist isn&rsquo;t bad except when you have to hold your mouth open for an hour straight while you periodically get waterboarded. There was one time this week where I went to work (it was another long 20 second commute), and I sat down and I said, screw this crappy job, and I left (it&rsquo;s ok, I just took paid time off). That weekend Emily&rsquo;s brother Keaton and his friend Landon came to town. We hiked Camelback mountain which was like doing stair steppers with 1000 city slickers. The view was spectacular, though. It made me want to do a &ldquo;real&rdquo; hike, which I haven&rsquo;t done in far too long. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/img_0148.jpg" alt="IMG_0148"><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/img_0176.jpg" alt="IMG_0176"> <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/img_0167.jpg" alt="IMG_0167"> We played Dead of Winter and I got the betrayer card AGAIN (hehehe). I stabbed everyone right in the face!! We&rsquo;ve been partying like it&rsquo;s 1699 <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/img_0194.jpg" alt="IMG_0194"><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/img_0206.jpg" alt="IMG_0206"><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/img_0181.jpg" alt="IMG_0181"><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/img_0180.jpg" alt="IMG_0180"><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/img_0190.jpg" alt="IMG_0190"> Thanks Monica for being the genius behind this^. Emily went to a Business Boutique and learned from a lot of great speakers like Rachel Cruze (Dave Ramsey&rsquo;s daughter) Rabbi Daniel Lapin, and lots of other people who have created businesses. When she arrived on the first day she had just sat down when she recognized an old friend, Stan Kjar who with her her daughter had flown in from Utah. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/img_0155.jpg" alt="IMG_0155"><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/img_0152.jpg" alt="IMG_0152"> After the event we went to In-N-Out, obviously, and then we went the Phoenix temple but as it turns it closes early on Saturday. Whoopsies. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/img_0178.jpg" alt="IMG_0178"> A week later before our Pandemic Legacy game night with Nathan and Corri, we thought we would be clever and go to the Phoenix temple since it&rsquo;s sort of on our way. Well, as it turns out, it was closed for maintenance!!!!1111 We were too far away to return home and still had a couple hours left until game night, so we decided to do the unexpected - the unthinkable. We went to a movie theater! I&rsquo;m serious, we NEVER go to the movies. Number one, we very rarely watch movies, because I look upon movies with scorn because they suck and Emily doesn&rsquo;t mind my snobbery. Well, we went all dressed up to a ghetto theater to see a movie called 10 Cloverfield Lane. Well Ladies and Gents, I had my doubts but that was an amazing movie. It wasn&rsquo;t the horrifically cliche action flick like I assume of it&rsquo;s progenitor (Cloverfield), it was something of a &ldquo;psychological thriller&rdquo; that kept  you guessing. I was never sure if the protaganist was a crazy guy or if he was a crazy guy and he was actually telling the truth. It was fascinating. A pitfall I see in a lot of movies (or rather, <em>saw</em> in a lot of movies) is they explain too much and don&rsquo;t allow for any tension as the viewer tries to figure it out themselves. Two giant acid barrels up for 10 Cloverfield Lane. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/img_0170.jpg" alt="IMG_0170"> Our game of Pandemic Legacy has been very exciting because we found out that [REDACTED] I would do almost any calling if it meant I didn&rsquo;t have to be a primary teacher. I would give a talk every month and clean the toilets rather than be a Sunbeam teacher. So of course we were called to be Sunbeam teachers. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/darth_vader_no.gif" alt="Darth_vader_no"> At least Emily is really good at it. I like Emily. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/img_0217.jpg" alt="IMG_0217"> Emily and I are attempting to go out and do one of those business things. We&rsquo;re continuing to build websites as practice. I&rsquo;ve been relearning a framework called Laravel that I haven&rsquo;t touched so I created <a href="http://dallincoons.com/dallin">my blog</a> over a year ago. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/img_0184.jpg" alt="IMG_0184"> <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/capture.png?w=1496" alt="Capture">   We&rsquo;re still figuring out what our &ldquo;product&rdquo;. We really want to create some kind of service that people would pay a subscription or something to rather than creating websites for small businesses. By the end of the year, either we have a business up and running or we have killer portfolios. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/img_0220.jpg" alt="IMG_0220"></p>
