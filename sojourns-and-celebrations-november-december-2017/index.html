    <p>I&rsquo;m sure you noticed that I haven&rsquo;t written in a couple months, and I&rsquo;m so sorry. I&rsquo;m so sorry to ruin 2017 for you! If you can&rsquo;t function at full capacity I totally understand. Boy howdy, what an eventful couple of months. Sit back, your feet up, and let me tell you all about it. First, Emily quit her job because, well, it&rsquo;s quite the story so you should ask her if you&rsquo;re dying to know. My little sister came to visit around the Thanksgiving holiday, and we took her to the amazing Joe&rsquo;s Italian Ice. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_2402-2.jpg" alt="IMG_2402 2">   It&rsquo;s pretty cool, it has a lot of vintage stuff like telephones that transmit signals through telephone lines, lololol. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_1747.jpg" alt="IMG_1747"> And she brought her child and left her husband at home. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_9399.jpg" alt="IMG_9399"> If anyone wants to come visit, that could be you too! Its sunny and warm here, you know you want tooooo. Then we headed out to California to celebrate Thanksgiving with Emily&rsquo;s grandparents, and caught some rays at the same time, which is obviously the best way to celebrate Thanksgiving. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_6595.jpg" alt="IMG_6595"><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_9797-2.jpg" alt="IMG_9797 2"> I unexpectedly got a phone call from a prospective employer, and things were going great..until I learned it&rsquo;s essentially a porn company. I said no thanks. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_3437.jpg" alt="IMG_3437"> <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_3846.jpg" alt="IMG_3846"> Sometime after we got back we went and did service at Feed My Starving children once again, which I highly recommend as a great way to do some service and feed some starving children. It pretty much consists of spending an hour packaging up food to be shipped off to third world countries. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_5139.jpg" alt="IMG_5139"> We headed off to Utah to attend a Lower Lights concert. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_5833.jpg" alt="IMG_5833"> <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_0672.jpg" alt="IMG_0672"> Random airplane guy and I are study buddies! <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_8834.jpg" alt="IMG_8834"> They look happy, but they&rsquo;re freezing and sad <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_4564.jpg" alt="IMG_4564"> Midnight I-Hop run for some reason (I&rsquo;m getting too old for this kind of thing). <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_6757.jpg" alt="IMG_6757"> <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_6073.jpg" alt="IMG_6073"> Behold, our Christmas decorations. That&rsquo;s about the extent of it: <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_3837.jpg" alt="IMG_3837"> We spent Christmas in Lakeside with my parents. It was super relaxing and enjoyable. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_0267-2.jpg?w=8064" alt="IMG_0267 2.JPG"> Then we went and visited the house where I lived for the first 11 years of my life in Podunk, AZ. The house is a shell of its former glory. There used to be a beautiful green lawn with rose bushes, and I don&rsquo;t remember the siding looking like crap, and oh well, <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_8808.jpg" alt="IMG_8808"> This is seriously one of Emily&rsquo;s favorite things of all time: big open sky. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_0604.jpg" alt="IMG_0604"> Taco Bell is good and I&rsquo;m sexy <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_1042.jpg" alt="IMG_1042"> We traveled to Northern Utah to visit Emily family for &ldquo;Step Christmas&rdquo; which is pretty much just Christmas a week after actual Christmas day. We used to do long 12-hour drives but these days it just seems so..long. We decided to stop on our way to Utah someone&rsquo;s house courtesy of Airbnb in Kanab, UT and discovered they have an awesome dog! (I&rsquo;m accepting sponsorship from Airbnb if any representatives happen to see this) <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_8890.jpg" alt="IMG_8890"> Dogs are cool <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_0313.jpg" alt="IMG_0313"> We like dogs <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_0314.jpg" alt="IMG_0314"> Someone else likes dogs too <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_3413.png" alt="IMG_3413"> Somewhere along the way, we took a picture of a rock <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_0290.jpg" alt="IMG_0290"> There&rsquo;s this whole tradition thing where we go to the store on Christmas Eve (or Step Christmas Eve) and get cereal. I got Fruit Gushers because nobody is stopping me and I&rsquo;m like, an adult, and Fruit Gushers are reeeal good. (I&rsquo;m accepting Fruit Gushers sponsorship if anyone from there is reading this.) <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_9369.jpg" alt="IMG_9369"> Step-Christmas morning <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_0320.jpg" alt="IMG_0320"> Pacman makes a great stock stuffer by the way. PRO TIP <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_8045.jpg" alt="IMG_8045"> Go to Cupbop in Utah, it&rsquo;s really good Korean barbeque. I can&rsquo;t remember where it&rsquo;s located though. I think it&rsquo;s in the city with all the Mormons. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_6963.jpg" alt="IMG_6963"> On the way back from Step-Christmas we visited Monument Valley. It was reeeally quiiiet. Just the way I like it. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_0357.jpg" alt="IMG_0357"> And we stayed in a cozy little cottage thingy <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_0347.jpg" alt="IMG_0347"> And this thing is where I want to live someday: <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_0349.jpg" alt="IMG_0349"> I saw a little up and coming band called the Descendants (lolololol) best known for their hit singles <em>I&rsquo;m Not a Loser</em>, <em>I Like Food</em> and <em>My Dad Sucks</em>. They actually don&rsquo;t tour much because their singer, Milo, is a biochemist by trade and doesn&rsquo;t generally have a lot of time to play punk rock shows these days. However, they&rsquo;ve been playing weekend shows all across the country for several months now, and they graced Arizona with their presence. They&rsquo;re all getting old, pushing 60, but they&rsquo;re still a bunch of goofballs, which is fitting for a band who has an album called I Don&rsquo;t Want to Grow Up, and often sing about how boring old people are. It&rsquo;s all very inspirational. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_6124.jpg" alt="IMG_6124"> Oh and I was poisoned by some meat I ate. Do vegetarians eat at Sweet Tomatoes every day or something, cause that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to do. (I&rsquo;m accepting sponsorship from Sweet Tomatoes, just saying) <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_0220.jpg" alt="IMG_0220">                                       <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_7277.jpg" alt="IMG_7277">                                                   <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_0327.jpg" alt="IMG_0327">                                                 <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_78401.jpg" alt="IMG_7840"></p>
