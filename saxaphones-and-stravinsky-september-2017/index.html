    <p>We&rsquo;re sick of doing the same things over and over, so this month we tried something a little different. This month, we played board games and went to music things!!!!11 There&rsquo;s this little band called the Melvins. Never heard of the Melvins? But you&rsquo;ve heard of Nirvana I&rsquo;m sure. Nirvana wouldn&rsquo;t have existed without the Melvins. These guys are legends. Legends who happen to play smallish clubs, including the Crescent Ballroom in downtown Phoenix. One of the reasons I absolutely needed to see them live was to see King Buzzo&rsquo;s hair in all it&rsquo;s magnificent glory. In case you weren&rsquo;t aware, King Buzzo has beautiful, wonderful, magnificent hair and wears strange robes. Wait, hold on, I don&rsquo;t know if I can explain it properly, just take a look for yourselves:         <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/kingbuzzo.jpg" alt="kingbuzzo"> What a great human. I desperately want this hairstyle. Curse my slightly curly hair. Also checkout this clip of Buzz trying to buy a house with his street credit. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time">https://www.youtube.com/watch?time</a>_continue=308&amp;v=HFn1UUI6bj8     After my being severely punished by the Melvins, it was a time for Mr. Stravinsky to punish us with his loud, dissonant, and creepily themed Rite of Spring. I guess people hated it when it first came out, but did Mr. Igor care? Nope, he knew it was great. The guy was a punk rocker. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_5800.jpg" alt="IMG_5800"> Also, there was a guest violin soloist named Phillipe Qunit who does stuff with a violin I&rsquo;ve never seen anyone do before. The guy could really shred. Have a sample, samplers: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2D-0ptU1GY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2D-0ptU1GY</a>   Then we went shopping for dogs, hoping to find the correct select. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_3363.jpg" alt="IMG_3363"> We found Franky, who didn&rsquo;t bark, but opted for the howl instead: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd-vAKkAvYk&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd-vAKkAvYk&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>   Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t think our apartment complex is going to allow such a dog, because certain breeds such as Mixed are far too dangerous. In protest, we attended a music thing: One of the greatest rock and roll bands of our generation: The Dirty Nil. Last time we saw them, there were MAYBE 15 people in the audience. Now they&rsquo;re playing to crowds of several hundred. Our little bands are growing up. I can prove the Dirty Nil are on the greatest rock and roll bands, because Luke chews bubblegum while he&rsquo;s playing and singing, and this is a real thing, evidenced by the fact that he blows bubbles while he&rsquo;s doing rock and roll things: <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/the-dirty-nil_2000-trees-festival-2017_slb_120-1-1024x684.jpg" alt="The-Dirty-Nil_2000-Trees-Festival-2017_SLB_120-1-1024x684"> He&rsquo;s very dynamic though, he&rsquo;s not always vaunting his rock and roll maneuvers. He has the ability to bring it down and tell you he don&rsquo;t care about your boyfriend. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_0281.jpg" alt="IMG_0281"> <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_9078-2.jpg" alt="IMG_9078 2"> Then I got to hang out with the Rock n&rsquo; Roll man himself. I can&rsquo;t believe I forgot to ask him though. What happened to Dave?!!! This is going to haunt me. DAAAAVVVE <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_6852-2.jpg" alt="IMG_6852 2"> Then, what the eeeeeeehhhh, wait is that a UFO?????? <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_5865.jpg" alt="IMG_5865"> <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_9307.jpg" alt="IMG_9307">   (Not another music thing, I don&rsquo;t want to hear about any more music things!!!) What if I told you, this music thing involved a guy with a Baritone Saxophone and pink hair, a flamboyant trumpet man, and a dude carrying a bass drum. THAT changes everything. Look here&rsquo;s a photograph of this very thing: <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_7344-2.jpg" alt="IMG_7344 2"> Hold on, I&rsquo;m not one of those jerks who takes pictures in the middle of concerts! And I was too busy dancing, erm jumping around like an idiot. That&rsquo;s right, these guys made me &ldquo;DANCE&rdquo;. AND I LIKED IT!!!!! The music isn&rsquo;t like anything I&rsquo;ve ever heard before, but their genre is self-proclaimed as &ldquo;Brasshouse&rdquo;. I can&rsquo;t describe, just check out Too Many Zooz playing on a subway train in New York: <a href="https://youtu.be/IMyqasy2Lco?t=1m12s">https://youtu.be/IMyqasy2Lco?t=1m12s</a> This was actually the first time they&rsquo;ve ever been to Arizona, and I wasn&rsquo;t sure if they were going to have much of a following, but people were jumping around and going crazy. It was a very good reception, especially for first-timers.   Then we escorted some chick named Princess Leia to a happy place where nobody wants to shoot at you, but we got a bit jammed up, as if we had eaten nothing but cheese and crackers for a week. In the end though it all came out nice and smooth.   <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_9672.jpg" alt="IMG_9672">   As for the rest of the month, it was pretty much &ldquo;I sat by the computer for hours, programming various things&rdquo;. Oh, what a good blog that would have made.                     <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_9307.jpg" alt="IMG_9307"> <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_9307.jpg" alt="IMG_9307"><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_9307.jpg" alt="IMG_9307"><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_9307.jpg" alt="IMG_9307"><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_9307.jpg" alt="IMG_9307"> <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_9307.jpg" alt="IMG_9307"> <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_9307.jpg" alt="IMG_9307"></p>
