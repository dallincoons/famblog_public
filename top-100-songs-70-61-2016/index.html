    <p><strong>Good Life - Weezer</strong> I love the early Weezer songs because of how much honesty and personal history is infused in each song. This song was written after Weezer had a very successful debut album and Rivers Cuomo, the singer and main songwriter, decided being a rock star sucked. He decided instead of being a rockstar, he would attend Harvard. This is part of a batch of songs that were written in the middle of winter in Boston. This particular tune is one of a Harvard student wishing he could go back to &ldquo;The Good Life&rdquo;. At this time he had to undergo surgery due to a defect he was born with in which one leg was shorter than the other, and so had to walk with a cane. He also had a big bushy beard and nobody ever recognized him as the singer for Weezer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I look in the mirror I can&rsquo;t believe what I see Tell me, who&rsquo;s that funky dude Staring back at me Broken, beaten down Can&rsquo;t even get around Without an old-man cane I fall and hit the ground Shivering in the cold I&rsquo;m bitter and alone Excuse the bitching I shouldn&rsquo;t complain I should have no feeling Cos feeling is pain As everything I need Is denied me And everything I want Is taken away from me But who do I got to blame? Nobody but me And I don&rsquo;t wanna be an old man anymore It&rsquo;s been a year or two since I was out on the floor Shaking booty, making sweet love all the night It&rsquo;s time I got back to the good life It&rsquo;s time I got back, it&rsquo;s time I got back And I don&rsquo;t even know how I got off the track I wanna go back, yeah!</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkroIXktjgE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkroIXktjgE</a> <strong>Recovering the Opposable Thumb - The Lawrence Arms</strong> This song as a great narrative arc. It starts off with Brendan Kelley almost morosely singing to the backdrop of a non-distorted guitar (as if he&rsquo;s recovering from a hangover?), then the band jumps in and the song takes a hash, urgent, almost angry tone, which transitions to the soaring anthem of the chorus. Those dual vocals where Brendan and Chris sing together make for a dynamic, harsh, yet upbeat song. <strong>100 Resolutions - The Lawrence Arms/Sundowner</strong> The Lawrence Arms is more punky and harsh, and the Sundowner version is a soft, soulful, acoustic version. I like them both.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another stupid clumsy story. More accidental aspirations. Another explosion of silence. I think I&rsquo;m going deaf, or maybe I&rsquo;m just hearing less. This year I&rsquo;ll try to only listen to myself. This year I&rsquo;ll try not to think too much. This year I&rsquo;ll try to stand up for myself. This year I&rsquo;ll live like I&rsquo;ve never lived before, this is my year for sure. I&rsquo;ve got 100 resolutions, but I&rsquo;ve got no solutions. I&rsquo;ve got one song I write 100 times. And only a dozen or so rhymes.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGVQ-VqmLKI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGVQ-VqmLKI</a>   <strong>Hurt - Johnny Cash</strong> I&rsquo;m amazed at how emotional this Nine Inch Nails cover is and how perfectly it fits the man in black. If you haven&rsquo;t seen the video, watch it! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt1Pwfnh5pc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt1Pwfnh5pc</a> <strong>Jumping the Shark</strong> I love this song for it&rsquo;s soaring, anthemic chorus which I believe captures beautifully and perfectly the emotion of wanting to move on from past mistakes and regrets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I fought with all of my teachers I fought with all of my friends I fought with the vices and sweating and shakes I&rsquo;m not going back there again. No, I&rsquo;m not going back there again.</p>
<p>Tonight, tonight I&rsquo;m walkin&rsquo; away. Tonight, tonight I&rsquo;m walkin&rsquo; away. I don&rsquo;t want to hear about old days - What are we doing today? Fake memories, they don&rsquo;t impress me. The old times were never that great.</p>
<p>We got the whole city Before us Tonight, tonight we&rsquo;re walkin&rsquo; away And I wanna bury The past Tonight, tonight we&rsquo;re walking away With bottles and dancing With whiskey and love Let&rsquo;s drink to the death of regret</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Noise Complaint - Big D and the Kids Table</strong> Now this is a party song. This is a fast paced, fun as hell Ska song with almost a Swing feel about having fun, making noise and bothering your neighbors. I like your neighbour but your neighbour don&rsquo;t like me!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sixty feet stomping (Noise Complaint!) Yeah the souped-up vinyl spinning (Noise Complaint!) Well laughing is a reason (Noise Complaint!) We&rsquo;re all spaz cap drinking (Noise Complaint!) Well it&rsquo;s a sure shot, we can&rsquo;t be stopped Twenty bucks says there&rsquo;s a noise complaint Tearing down the curtains (Noise Complaint!) We&rsquo;re just blowing out the speakers (Noise Complaint!) You know the neighbors pound the floorboards (Noise Complaint!) Yeah, this party ain&rsquo;t no secret (Noise Complaint!) Well it&rsquo;s a sure shot, we can&rsquo;t be stopped Yeah alright yeah there&rsquo;s a noise complaint, Oi! Police rack the front door (Noise Complaint!) Then all them girls hit the closet (Noise Complaint!) You know I&rsquo;m underneath the bed now (Noise Complaint!) It&rsquo;s just a chance for naughty smooching (Noise Complaint!) Well it&rsquo;s a sure shot, we can&rsquo;t be stopped We&rsquo;re sorry officer &lsquo;bout the noise complaint Frigging in the rigging (Noise Complaint!) Yeah there&rsquo;s smoggin&rsquo; in my noggin&rsquo; (Noise Complaint!) We&rsquo;re all playing back seat bingo (Noise Complaint!) Are you hip to my lingo (Noise Complaint!) Well it&rsquo;s a sure shot, we can&rsquo;t be stopped Back it up kid there&rsquo;s a noise complaint, Oi!</p></blockquote>
<p>You owe it to yourself to check out this song: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxGH2h2paY0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxGH2h2paY0</a>   <strong>Shining On - Big D and the Kids Table</strong> This is why I love the format of an album. This is the next track after Noise Complaint, which has a totally different feel to it. The video actually depicts this song as being the morning after the crazy party. It&rsquo;s a slow, strolling about being carefree and having fun despite life not always going perfectly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I can&rsquo;t help from just smiling When that damn sun is shinning on Hell, It&rsquo;s just Shinning down all over me No, I can&rsquo;t help but just smile While that damn sun is shining on Dang, it&rsquo;s just shining down Down over me</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUCtZn-INGo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUCtZn-INGo</a> <strong>Kept By Bees - Future of the Left</strong> The drums start banging and then come some very bizarre lyrics I&rsquo;ve ever heard. Even the style of the singing itself makes you wonder if these guys don&rsquo;t have a screw loose..and I love it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing like being owned Kept by bees in a jelly mold Brought out on special occasions Served with black entertainment Measured by the size of the rash minus income Kept by bees in a glass case Next to Atlantis, rendered badly with my oil paints Trapped by ESP in the darkness All those guys, they just want a part in your story</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5Jp9cisyMU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5Jp9cisyMU</a> <strong>Small Bones Small Bodies - Future of the Left</strong> Another bizarre Future of the Left banger. And a banger it is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Small bones small bodies, sink into semantics The slightest excuse - the tiniest exo-skeleton She said, the fossil, it sets such a standard Forgetting the reason - small bones, bigger problems With this, I miss you, I finally admit that And beg forgiveness, my finest exo-skeleton I am the fossil, we are the fossil, that beg forgiveness Small bones small bodies</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxdBUXQfpUg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxdBUXQfpUg</a> <strong>Career Opportunities - The Clash</strong> I love the Clash but I sometimes wish they were a little more snotty. This song delivers the attitude which is why I put it in my top 100.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They offered me the office, offered me the shop They said I&rsquo;d better take anything they&rsquo;d got Do you wanna make tea at the BBC? Do you wanna be, do you really wanna be a cop?</p>
<p>Career opportunities, the ones that never knock Every job they offer you is to keep you out the dock Career opportunities, the ones that never knock</p>
<p>I hate the army and I hate the RAF I don&rsquo;t wanna go fighting in the tropical heat I hate the civil service rules I won&rsquo;t open letter bombs for you</p>
<p>Career opportunities, the ones that never knock Every job they offer you is to keep you out the dock Career opportunities, the ones that never knock</p></blockquote>
