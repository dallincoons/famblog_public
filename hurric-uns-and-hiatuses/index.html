    <p>In August we traveled to Hurric-un (it&rsquo;s a hick Utah pronunciation - just go with it) for the annual family vacation on Emily&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>To kick things off right, we did the nerdiest thing you could possibly do other than larping. Dungeons and Dragons, which all we all know, is Satan&rsquo;s game. This is what it looks like to be sucked into the occult.</p>

<p>I think we won the game.</p>
<p>We woke up bright and early to go on a hike-that-was-really-a-walk through a ghost town doubling as the movie set of the 1959 western flick, <em>They Came to Cordura</em>.</p>
<p>Sadly, there had been wildfire there a week or two before, and had burned much of the set, but at least this gazebo made it.</p>

<p>Another fun thing that happened is Kev went swimming for the first time in his life.</p>

<p>Several of us went on an excursion to St George to go shopping at a consignment shop. Last year I had scored a couple of great records for a few bucks each, so I was hoping for similar luck. Sadly, I didn&rsquo;t find anything, but we still had fun wandering around downtown St George going to thrift stores, pawn shops, and books stores. I never thought I&rsquo;d say this, but I kind of enjoy shopping sometimes. It all started with the record stores, then shopping for weird clothes at consignment shops, and now I go out with my girlfriends to get manicures!</p>
<p>So, I quit my job. And I have a new job. I gave myself 3 whole days where I didn&rsquo;t have a job.</p>
<p>On the first of these three days, we planned to go to Yellowstone. If you&rsquo;re an avid reader of this blog, as you should be, you may recall that we tried to go to Yellowstone last April, and it started snowing, which caused us to abort mission because we were too ill prepared.</p>
<p>Well, this time around, we went in August when it&rsquo;s sunny and warm. Well, every day was sunny and warm except the day we planned to go. That day was cold and rainy. But we made sure to bring warm clothes so we could stick it out to the bitter end and have fun, damnit!</p>
<p>We figured it would be relatively empty, because it was a cold, rainy Monday. But alas, it was still swarming with people. So we made sure to bring our masks so we could take pictures and demonstrate how virtuous we are (we only wore them for the picture of course).</p>
<p><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/img_7856.jpg?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>For the most part, we were able to avoid people, though. Good thing, because I hate people.</p>
<p><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/img_7840-1.jpg?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>And we found an isolated meadow to eat lunch at - with no people, because as we already went over, I hate people. These are the only two people I like to see in a meadow while eating lunch.</p>

<p>As a side note, here&rsquo;s a bit of wisdom that I&rsquo;ve gained: when you&rsquo;re at cool places like Yellowstone, you are going to be very tempted to take pictures of scenery. The problem with that is that you&rsquo;re never going to be able to fully capture the grandeur and beauty properly, and it&rsquo;s just not going to be that interesting to look at later. Not to mention that many skilled photographers with much more expensive cameras than you have taken 8 billion photos and have posted them online. A simple tweak, or a &ldquo;life hack&rdquo;, if you will, is to take a picture with someone you like in the foreground of the cool background, which magically turns it into something you actually might be interested in looking at later!</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Kev won&rsquo;t remember a thing, we still had a good time!</p>
<p>Kev is in the phase where he is highly mobile, highly curious, and he gets into everything.</p>

<p>And to wrap it all up, here are some cute pictures from what just might be the cutest baby ever.</p>
