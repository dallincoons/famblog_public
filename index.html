        <p>We&rsquo;ve built up quite a montage of Calvin playing with cars and trucks and digging in dirt. I think we&rsquo;ve identified his favorite activity, and one of our favorite activities is taking redundant pictures of his cuteness. He also humors us and goes on hikes (eh, more like nature walks), but maybe that&rsquo;s because he knows we always have some trucks stashed away to play with. On our walks, we often stumble upon highly diggable dirt and those come in handy.</p>

        <p>This might seem like it&rsquo;s coming out of the blue but we&rsquo;re changing Kevin&rsquo;s name to Calvin. We&rsquo;ve been thinking about this since almost the day he was born.</p>
<p>When we were picking a name during pregnancy for the life of us we couldn&rsquo;t decide on a name for a boy that we liked. Ramone was our favorite, but we were reluctant to use what traditionally is a Hispanic name as his first name. Additionally, we (mostly Emily) were concerned about trying to incorporate a family name. We thought about using the name Don(ald) but President 45, who we weren&rsquo;t particular fans of, ruined that idea for us. We wanted a name that would go with Ramone and since we <em>are</em> fans of my dad we went with &lsquo;Kevin Ramone&rsquo; which has a nice ring to it.</p>

        I’ve loved collecting vinyl, much of it from criminally obscure bands who only pressed 300 copies of a record in 2014 or whatever. A part of me thinks of record collecting as ‘archiving’. You might ask why I collect vinyl if I can hear the music on the internet. Or you might not ask, in which case I will give the answers unsolicited.

        <p>I was baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints when I was 8 years old, which is the Catholic equivalent of being baptized as an infant, and I have been a faithful member for most of my life since then. The LDS church is not just a church to attend on Sunday. It’s a lifestyle that governs many, if not most, aspects of one&rsquo;s life. All of my major life decisions have been influenced by my belief in the teachings of the church.</p>

        <p>January has historically been the toughest month of the year, at least the years where we&rsquo;ve lived somewhere cold. The thrill of Christmas has gone the way of the carbonation in a flat, half-finished can of coke and the road to spring looks arduous and cold. Emily might seem nice and all, but as long as I&rsquo;ve known her she has had a deep, abiding hatred in her heart for snow. Indeed, our ideal location is somewhere in the beautiful desolation of a warm desert with NO SNOW. We&rsquo;re not totally sure where that is, but wherever it is we&rsquo;d prefer to <em>know</em> we&rsquo;re living in the desert, not just a city with hot sidewalks (like the center of Phoenix). We would love to live somewhere with big starry nights, open desert land, and ABSOLUTELY NO SNOW. But that&rsquo;s just a dream at the moment.</p>

        <p>There is the way life works and there is the way I wish life worked. This is how I wish it worked: if you have good intentions, you are guaranteed to make good decisions. However, it doesn&rsquo;t take much imagination to produce scenarios where this isn&rsquo;t the case. For example, I may have good intentions to fix my friend&rsquo;s car, but unless I&rsquo;ve gained knowledge in car mechanics somewhere along the way, I may actually do more harm than good. Or I may have good intentions by giving an alcoholic family member money when this could likely be enabling bad behavior. This is also very applicable to politics. A politician claiming better intent than an opponent does not automatically mean proposed policies will make the world a better place, and in fact could be utterly counterproductive.</p>

This is a language I&rsquo;m new to but is one that I was very interested in gaining more experience in. At least 6 months before I started this job I read a book about Go and started solving programming puzzles through a website called <a href="http://exercism.io">exercism.io</a> which has volunteer mentors to help you learn a language. I also started building an app for analyzing expected moves in the stock market using Go. In the end, this was enough for me to land a job. This the formula I&rsquo;ve used to find employment in software engineering without a college degree:</p>

        <p>There&rsquo;s a common type of social media post, most typically from parents of small children. You know the ones. Parents are overflowing with gratitude and positivity. I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of such posts. However, I don&rsquo;t believe they adequately capture the full spectrum of the wellspring of emotion that comes with being a parent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a parent (as of one year ago) so I can say with some first-hand knowledge that sometimes you do feel an extra measure of gratitude and joy, but more often life just as glamorous and romantic as it usually isn&rsquo;t. For some, I imagine candor about the negative aspect of parenthood might seem selfish or overly despondent. However, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s wise to brush reality under the rug and pretend that parenthood is a perpetual Christmas card family portrait. Prospective parents should be given as much information as possible about what to expect after they&rsquo;re done expecting.</p>

        <p>Boundaries, a book by Henry Cloud and John Townsend, makes me wonder what percentage of human malcontent is a direct result of some level of inappropriate boundaries. The subject of boundaries is a meaty one as I&rsquo;ve discovered, but I will sample a few specifics of what I found to be the most thought-provoking ideas:</p>
<p>Having appropriate boundaries in our lives means having the discernment to know when to say &rsquo;no&rsquo; and when to say &lsquo;yes&rsquo;, which is fundamental to healthy, fulfilling, and mutually beneficial relationships.</p>

While I have more of a tendency to roam into the heavier music, and I seem to have a greater affinity for ska and reggae than she does, we both enjoy much of the same things. One of the bands that we both love is a band called Screaming Females.</p>
<p>Screaming Females is a great band name, but a bit of a misnomer. While the band is indeed fronted by a female, the other two people in the band are dudes. Also, there&rsquo;s no screaming; at least not very much.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of interviewing lately, and it&rsquo;s been interesting to see the different interview styles. Software engineering interviews are always different but still have some common characteristics.

<p>I have been feeling the itch to start blogging again, although I&rsquo;m not yet sure exactly what form it will take. The monthly updates are fun, but I also would like to write more &ldquo;big idea&rdquo; kind of stuff, and sometimes I just want to talk about me, which is what most of this post will probably consist of. Maybe I&rsquo;ll just let inertia have it&rsquo;s way with me, and I&rsquo;ll do precisely nothing.

        In my last update, I told the story of my turning down a job opportunity at a company helping out the lovely, enchanting porn industry. In this episode of dubious job opportunities, I met with some dudes probably somewhere around my age in a fancy office in Scottsdale, and they told me tells of riches and a new cryptocurrency.

        <p>I&rsquo;m sure you noticed that I haven&rsquo;t written in a couple months, and I&rsquo;m so sorry. I&rsquo;m so sorry to ruin 2017 for you! If you can&rsquo;t function at full capacity I totally understand. Boy howdy, what an eventful couple of months. Sit back, your feet up, and let me tell you all about it. First, Emily quit her job because, well, it&rsquo;s quite the story so you should ask her if you&rsquo;re dying to know.</p>

        <p>One time we decided to spend an entire Saturday in a magical far away land called Prescott, because it seems like a mysterious mystical town tucked away somewhere in the Arizona desert, and also we&rsquo;re looking for places to live that&rsquo;s not in the center of a giant metropolitan.</p>

        <p>We&rsquo;re sick of doing the same things over and over, so this month we tried something a little different. This month, we played board games and went to music things!!!!11 There&rsquo;s this little band called the Melvins. Never heard of the Melvins? But you&rsquo;ve heard of Nirvana I&rsquo;m sure. Nirvana wouldn&rsquo;t have existed without the Melvins. These guys are legends. Legends who happen to play smallish clubs, including the Crescent Ballroom in downtown Phoenix. One of the reasons I absolutely needed to see them live was to see King Buzzo&rsquo;s hair in all it&rsquo;s magnificent glory.</p>

        <p>Primus show! If you don&rsquo;t know who Primus is, think of an eclectic mix of Rock N Roll, Larry Graham-esque slap bass, and Willy Wonka. It&rsquo;s truly a beautiful thing. If you don&rsquo;t like Primus then, up yours, you silly non-freak person. I met up my buddy Colton who I haven&rsquo;t hung out with in literally 10 years. He&rsquo;s been into Primus as far back as I can remember, but I&rsquo;m ashamed to say I never got into them.</p>

        Our A/C went out and the apartment complex we live in paid for us to stay in a hotel. We traveled to California and ate food next to dangerous chemicals.

        <p>Howdy y&rsquo;all, this past month saw us doing a whole lot of NOTHING. At least from an outsiders perspective. But first I must mention that Emily visited her family in Utah and she met the new little rat dog named Moose. Emily likes dogs in case you didn&rsquo;t know.</p>

        I think I have a higher than average sensitivity to noise. Even small noises have always bothered me. It&#39;s nice to have the fan on when I&#39;m sleeping, but if it makes even the slightest bit of unusual noise, fuh-get-about-it.

        <p>I recently came across this mission letter I wrote toward the end of my mission and consists of some fairly mundane details, however, I thought it was a good demonstration of a day in the life in the mission - or at least my mission. I share this partially because it&rsquo;s an amusing retrospective but also because I want to add a bit of realism to the naively romanticized idea what missionary work is like that most prospective missionaries have, including myself once upon a time.</p>

        <p>Looks who&rsquo;s back! Did you miss us? You know, I&rsquo;m terrified of becoming a boring, old, low-energy 9-5 commuter who no longer finds child-like joy in the world. That&rsquo;s partially what the blog is for. It&rsquo;s one of the tools in my toolset to help keep the adventure alive. I&rsquo;ve consistently written a blog every month for the past few years. One of the qualities that I like about myself is that I generally have a lot of self-integrity: when I decide to do something, I do it. If I decide I&rsquo;m going to go to the gym every day, I go to the freaking gym every day. When I decide I&rsquo;m going to write a blog every month, that&rsquo;s what I do.</p>

        <p>We travelled to Rexburg for my sister Janae and her husband Mark&rsquo;s graduation from BYU-Idaho. It was good that we went there in the winter time because we didn&rsquo;t feel as nostalgic as we were worried we might be. We&rsquo;re happy living somewhere warm, thank you very much.</p>

        Google thought they would be clever and look for things related to &#34;Christmas Party&#34; and associate an image with it. Silly Google. We played Sheriff of Nottingham, which may or may not involve smuggling contraband. This guy is definitely shady. All you have to do is look at him to know that.

        <p>Emily and I attended a band that we&rsquo;re both fans of - The Dirty Nil. This young band is the glorious mixture of Classic Rock and Punk Rock. In fact, the main front man, Luke Bentham has a tradition of taking the stage wearing a star-smattered shirt in homage to MC5. These fellas know how to put on a great show.</p>

        <p>One normal, average morning Emily went outside to find&hellip;all the cars missing in the parking lot? Did somebody still everybody&rsquo;s cars? Nope. The pavement needed a manicure and so someone towed every car to the other side of the building without warning us(!). I&rsquo;m far more amazed, even impressed, that someone actually did this than I am put off by the confusion and slight inconvenience.</p>

        <p>Well, well, well. Fancy seeing you here. Come on in and I&rsquo;ll tell you all about our comings and goings. Have a seat. Allow me to be introspective for a moment. This was my first month of working remotely. The people I&rsquo;m working with are &ldquo;A players&rdquo;, which is simultaneously very good and very stressful because I also have to put forth my best effort, and I often feel like an idiot. But you know what? This is exactly the kind of environment I want to be in.</p>

        <p>We&rsquo;ve been working on the design phase of a recipe and grocery list web app named Pepper Rodeo that we are building. We&rsquo;ve determined that we want to spend 90 percent of our time designing it and so when it comes time to code it, you can bang out the code in no time flat. That&rsquo;s something I learned at college. See? Sometimes college isn&rsquo;t always a waste of time.</p>

        <p>Well we moved to a new place YET AGAIN. Why? Cause we get bored, that&rsquo;s why. And I wanted to be closer to work I guess. Yes we successfully moved to Tempe, which is the city next door to Phoenix. Tempe is a poop dump. Well not really, but there&rsquo;s a lot of college students. That&rsquo;s it, I&rsquo;m flossing. I had to go to the dentist to get some teeth filled. My mom&rsquo;s enamel sucks and seems like I inherited it. Going to the dentist isn&rsquo;t bad except when you have to hold your mouth open for an hour straight while you periodically get waterboarded.</p>

<p>Calvin is growin up fast, but I&rsquo;m glad that there are things that remain the same to help keep the illusion that he&rsquo;s not going to become a snotty teenager someday soon. Cars remain the main pasttime around here.</p>

<p>Grandpa Kevin and Grandma Melly visited, and Calvin bonded with Grandpa Kevin showing off his hotwheel cars while Grandpa guessed what they were.
