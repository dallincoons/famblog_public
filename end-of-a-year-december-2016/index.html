    <p>We travelled to Rexburg for my sister Janae and her husband Mark&rsquo;s graduation from BYU-Idaho. It was good that we went there in the winter time because we didn&rsquo;t feel as nostalgic as we were worried we might be. We&rsquo;re happy living somewhere warm, thank you very much. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_0411.jpg" alt="img_0411"> <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_2093.jpg" alt="img_2093"> <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_0408.jpg" alt="img_0408"> In Rexburg, sometimes you have to scrape the inside of the windows. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_0401.jpg" alt="img_0401"><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_0403.jpg" alt="img_0403"> You can&rsquo;t even see their dresses because of the stupid coats. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_2092.jpg" alt="img_2092"> <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_2081.jpg" alt="img_2081"><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_2087.jpg" alt="img_2087"><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_2074.jpg" alt="img_2074"><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_2057.jpg" alt="img_2057"><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_2053.jpg" alt="img_2053"><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_2052.jpg" alt="img_2052"> <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_2089.jpg" alt="img_2089"> <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/beaker.png" alt="beaker"> <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_2096.jpg" alt="img_2096"><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_2046.jpg" alt="img_2046"><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_2044.jpg" alt="img_2044"><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_2042.jpg" alt="img_2042"> We travelled to Hurricuhn for Christmas, and you would think that travelling from Arizona to southern Utah would be a warm, uneventful affair but no, we encountered a lot of scary snow and almost died. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_2112.jpg" alt="img_2112"> <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_2162.jpg" alt="img_2162"> <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_21641.jpg" alt="img_2164"> Look it&rsquo;s even snowing in Hurricuhn.

We had a pretty sick view. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_2032.jpg" alt="img_2032"> Taco Bell makes absolutely no sense! But they make good burritos so who cares!!! <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_0396.jpg" alt="img_0396"> We read booooooooks <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_2021.jpg" alt="img_2021"> We went to a party for Emily&rsquo;s work. Everyone got drunk except us, so we had to act like we were totally wasted to fit in! <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_2016.jpg" alt="img_2016"> We watched the Phoenix Symphony perform Handel&rsquo;s Messiah. We made sure to hold our cell phones really high through the entire performance! <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_2014.jpg" alt="img_2014"> No cake for my birthday, just ice cream! <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_2234.jpg" alt="img_2234"><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_2231.jpg" alt="img_2231"> How could you forget my birthday? That&rsquo;s really immature. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_2221.jpg" alt="img_2221"> <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_04361.jpg" alt="img_0436">   In case you haven&rsquo;t heard, or you&rsquo;re an idiot, it&rsquo;s the end of the year! I really like stats so here are some numbers from 2016. Yes I keep track of how many times I play each board game. I told you I like stats, don&rsquo;t ask questions. Three most played board games in 2016: 3) Pandemic Legacy - 16 2) Spyfall - 33 1) Codenames - 37 I checked out a lot of new music this year. Around the year 2000, I used to download music from Napster, and as cool as that was at the time, having to wait for an individual song is downloaded before being able to listen to it by today standards seems laughably archaic. Now I can get to almost any song by almost any artist with the clicks of a few keystrokes. In 2016 I listened on Spotify to 683 hours of music on Spotify, or 28 solid days 990 total unique artists 5,244 unique songs We watched probably 5 or 6 movies this year. I&rsquo;m a harsh critic on movies but here&rsquo;s a couple that I loved: 10 Cloverfield Lane, Eddie the Eagle, and Rouge One. We watched four tv series over the course of the year. They were four amazing, amazing, shows. These are now four of my favourite shows of all time, ranked by preference, although this may be splitting hairs somewhat because they&rsquo;re all so good: 4) Walking Dead 3) Stranger Things 2) House of Cards 1) and my favorite, Breaking Bad. I think I&rsquo;ve discovered that I really like anti-heroes. I tried to make Emily pick her favorite, but she can&rsquo;t do it.   In 2016, my favorite accomplishments: I got a work from home job!! We built a recipe/grocery list manager, called PepperRodeo.com, which we learned A TON from doing, and are continuing to improve it. That wraps up 2016. 2016 was cool because it&rsquo;s a nice round composite number. 2017 is a lame prime number :(   Ok bye.           <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/img_2090.jpg" alt="img_2090"></p>
