    <p>I haven&rsquo;t written a proper monthly update since July of 2018, which is almost 2 years ago. Time has been a very limited resource lately, and so I&rsquo;ll make that my official excuse. Yeah, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I have been feeling the itch to start blogging again, although I&rsquo;m not yet sure exactly what form it will take. The monthly updates are fun, but I also would like to write more &ldquo;big idea&rdquo; kind of stuff, and sometimes I just want to talk about me, which is what most of this post will probably consist of. Maybe I&rsquo;ll just let inertia have it&rsquo;s way with me, and I&rsquo;ll do precisely nothing. But in all seriousness, blogging really is time consuming, and time is the most precious resource in the world to me.</p>
<p>On that note, maybe I&rsquo;ll finally have the guts to delete my social media accounts once and for all. Time will tell, heh?</p>
<p>Being back at school has been a weird experience, in that I already have a skillset and a &ldquo;real job&rdquo;, while the people I associate with in my classes are generally 10 years younger than me and relatively inexperienced and are at the bottom of the totem pole called life.</p>
<p>However, the point of going back to school is for me to throw myself back into a situation where I&rsquo;m also inexperienced, and at the bottom of the heap. When it comes to math and statistics, I am indeed at the bottom. I consider that to be a very good thing as I would consider this school experience to be a complete waste of time otherwise.</p>
<p>Math is something that people love bragging about not being good at, and I&rsquo;m not going to claim to be free of that particular sin. However, the older I get, the more I regret having avoided learning math my whole life, which relegated me to mathematical impotency.</p>
<p>When I started this journey a year and a half ago, I told myself that I wanted to qualify for and pass a Calculus class. Now, I&rsquo;m fully aware that many people took Calculus in high school. However, for me, passing Calculus as a 30-something-year-old is going to be a huge accomplishment.</p>
<p>Next semester, I will be officially attempting to accomplish my goal, by taking Calculus as the final class I complete at BYU-Idaho, as I finally(!) close this chapter!</p>
<p>What do I want to do after I graduate? I don&rsquo;t know. Most likely something very similar to what I&rsquo;m already doing. Here are my options, though:</p>
<ol>
<li>Continue in software engineering. This is the mostly likely scenario and is a great option (I love programming). In this scenario, I would like my next gig to be a significant step up, and I feel like I am qualified for such a thing. I&rsquo;ve been starting to put my feelers out for job opportunities. I was contacted by a recruiter from Amazon and I&rsquo;ve already gone through a first round interview. To be clear, to work at a place that hires the best of the best, one generally needs to put in a non-insignificant amount of preparation to make it through the intense interviewing process. I have not had the luxury to prepare, as I&rsquo;ve been busy learning data science things. However, I was interested in interviewing so that at the very least I would have a better idea of how close I am in skill level to make it at a place like Amazon (and I can always try again in 6 months). I haven&rsquo;t heard the results from the first round interview yet, and I don&rsquo;t anticipate that I will progress to the next round, which was expected going into it. But I was pleased with how well I did with the code challenge considering I put in zero preparation. It gave me confidence that <em>it might actually be possible.</em> Give me some more time to study and practice, and it definitely seems within the realm of possibility that I could have a shot. Maybe not necessarily at Amazon either, but hopefully at least someplace where they are doing cool stuff.</li>
<li>My second option is to attempt a career pivot, and try to get an entry level data science job. I&rsquo;m not particularly enthused about essentially starting my career over, especially because I already enjoy the one I have. I am interested in data science, but I suspect that to do any of the cool stuff in data science I am going to have to be proficient in math, and I&rsquo;m still at the point where making it through a first-level Calculus class feels like a major accomplishment.</li>
<li>Which leads me to another benefit of officially obtaining a bachelors degree. It possibly opens up the door to graduate school (gasp). This probably isn&rsquo;t likely, but if time and money were no object, I would love to try it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Where will we end up living? I have not one clue.</p>
<p>NEXT!!</p>
<p>At this point in the blog post, I should add some deprecating humor about how I&rsquo;ve talked about myself for the past 6 paragraphs and then talk about Emily in order to prove my love to everyone. I should also make sure at the end to add in all the stock things that I&rsquo;m grateful for, that sounds exactly like what everyone else is grateful for. Look, I&rsquo;m a social media natural!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what the rest of us have been up to (I&rsquo;ll make sure to cherry pick all the good stuff so that we look good).</p>
<p>Of course, Emily has been busy keeping Kev alive (insert obligatory statement to make sure everyone knows that I know how important mothers are). When we moved to the mean streets of Rexburg, Idaho, she kept her graphic and web design job, which was a work from home gig. She took a break during the baby craze/haze. She&rsquo;s now picked up a second job. Both jobs are variable in terms of how much work she does and are very flexible in hours. Since she&rsquo;s the one with the boobies, she&rsquo;s the one feeding Kev, but working seems like it helps break up the monotony and keeps the brain juices flowing.</p>
<p>THIS happened, on May 23:</p>
<p><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/img_8675.jpg?w=768" alt=""></p>
<p>And it looked like THIS the next day:</p>
<p><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/img_2608.jpg?w=768" alt=""></p>
<p>The hell?</p>
<p>In other news, Kev is friggin cute, and you&rsquo;ll probably never make as cute of babies as us! Devastating!</p>
<p><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/kutekev.jpg?w=768" alt=""></p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re really here for the Kev update. He is almost 6 months already, and he does things typical six-month-olds do. He poops, he eats, he rolls, and now he even lets us sleep.</p>
<p>He went through a phase for a couple weeks where he could roll from his back to his stomach, but not from his stomach to his back. For a while there, we had to constantly rescue him when he would roll to his stomach and then proceed to get stuck and start squawking at us. Something like</p>
<p>&ldquo;eeehehhehhhhhhehhhehehheh!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;d help him roll to his back, only for him to roll to his stomach, squawk at us, ad infinitum.</p>
<p>The good news is, it&rsquo;s only going to get easier from here!</p>
<p>To be continued&hellip;how much will Kev poop next? Will he sleep, or will he cry? Can we possibly handle any more cuteness? Find out, on the next exhilarating episode!</p>
