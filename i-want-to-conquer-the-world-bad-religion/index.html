Hey Sister Bleeding Heart with all of your compassion, Your labors soothe the hurt but can’t assuage temptation.

Is your fecundity a trammel or a treasure? Hey Mr. Diplomat with your worldly aspirations, Did you see the children cry when you left them at the station? Hey moral soldier you’ve got righteous proclamation, And precious tomes to fuel your pulpy conflagrations. And I want to conquer the world, Give all the idiots a brand new religion, Put an end to poverty, uncleanliness and toil, Promote equality in all of my decisions I want to conquer the world, Expose the culprits and feed them to the children, I’ll do away with air pollution and then all save the whales, We’ll have peace on earth and global communion. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2nlrpudHIM">
