    <p>Well, well, well. Fancy seeing you here. Come on in and I&rsquo;ll tell you all about our comings and goings. Have a seat. Allow me to be introspective for a moment. This was my first month of working remotely. The people I&rsquo;m working with are &ldquo;A players&rdquo;, which is simultaneously very good and very stressful because I also have to put forth my best effort, and I often feel like an idiot. But you know what? This is exactly the kind of environment I want to be in. I have a tendency to throw myself in uncomfortable situations for the sake of education. &ldquo;Real&rdquo; education isn&rsquo;t always fun and often comes at a price. At my last job, I started off overwhelmed and I left a year-and-almost-a-half later because I had gotten too comfortable. That and I outgrew my salary. I have this ever-present concern, perhaps even a fear that my growth will stagnate and I won&rsquo;t learn as much as I should, and that someday I&rsquo;ll wake up and realize I&rsquo;m like the programmer who learned UniBasic in the 70&rsquo;s and never learned anything new and is now obsolete in the marketplace. Speaking of dust storms, here&rsquo;s a picture of one. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_1492.jpg" alt="IMG_1492"> We went to an amazing <strong>Andrew Jackson Jihad</strong> show, which served as a record release show for their new album. I believe the show sold out, as when we showed up and bought our tickets, they said there were only 43 tickets left. To demonstrate how much I love this band, I recently compiled a list of my <a href="https://dallincoons.wordpress.com/2016/08/29/top-100-songs-100-91/">favorite 100 songs</a> in which I probably have more of their songs than any other band. I didn&rsquo;t want to take a picture during the actual show because that would just be stupid, so Emily took one of me in between sets of the opening bands so that I could share my excitement with all the world: <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_1505.jpg" alt="IMG_1505"> Birds! Pidgeons made a home on our balcony and laid eggs. I know, many people  view pigeons as vexing pests, but we don&rsquo;t go on our balcony in the summertime, are you crazy? So we may as well view nature take its course. Shhhhhhh. Look its hatching <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_1511.jpg" alt="IMG_1511"> Speaking of animals, I don&rsquo;t like cats. But cats like me apparently. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_1515.jpg" alt="IMG_1515"><img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_1519.jpg" alt="IMG_1519"> Just for the record, dogs are a 1,000,000,000,000,000 times better than cats. But cats are ok if there&rsquo;s nothing else around. We&rsquo;re nerds! So we went to a UX TV show taping. For those of you who don&rsquo;t &ldquo;habla Espanol&rdquo;, UX is a dumb and inaccurate acronym for User Experience. You know when you go to a website and you can&rsquo;t frickin&rsquo; find anything but it&rsquo;s a government website or something so there&rsquo;s no competitors and they didn&rsquo;t feel the need to hire any User Experience people? Or when you visit something like Amazon and you have a 20% chance of accidentally buying because it&rsquo;s so easy? Anyways, this &ldquo;TV show&rdquo; which is more like a youtube show, was about exactly that. They had people who built websites and apps compete for whose is easiest to use! Riveting! <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_1532.jpg" alt="IMG_1532"> And we look super fancy! All right! <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_1542.jpg" alt="IMG_1542"> WOW! <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_1543.jpg" alt="IMG_1543"> One day, we went to Tuscon to attend a surprise 85th birthday party for my Grandpa. In case you don&rsquo;t know, Tuscon is a land of tumbleweeds and saloons, where the dresscode is cowboy hats and flannel and you have to say stuff like &ldquo;howdy pardner&rdquo;. Oh and did I mention that if you wear a tie, they&rsquo;ll cut it off and hang it up! &lsquo;Cause that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s done in the Wild West. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_0318.jpg" alt="img_0318"> In the West, there&rsquo;s certain rules for how to eat your cake: <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_1567.jpg" alt="IMG_1567"> That feeling when there&rsquo;s no more cake to be had: <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_1573.jpg" alt="IMG_1573"> We went and watched some folks jump off roofs and blow stuff up: <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_1578.jpg" alt="IMG_1578"> Here&rsquo;s the posse <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_1600.jpg" alt="IMG_1600"> And meanwhile, the birds just kept getting bigger <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_1583.jpg" alt="IMG_1583"> My GOSH I&rsquo;m sexy <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_0302.jpg" alt="IMG_0302">                                                                                                 <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_1573.jpg" alt="IMG_1573"></p>
