Graeters ice cream is one of the clients that I&rsquo;ve been working with for the past year. I discovered they distrubute their wares at our local grocery store. It&rsquo;s too expensive though so forget that, I&rsquo;m just going to pose and put it back on the shelf. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/img_5210.jpg" alt="IMG_5210"> This month we got to see Laura Stevenson for the third time. Doors were supposed to open at 8:00 but here we are past 8:30 with a long line of people. Not sure what that was about. While we were standing in line, one of the guys from one of my favorite bands, Andrew Jackson Jihad came by and played with the kid that you can see with that glow stick (it sounded like he was friends with the dad). We just assumed he was there to watch the Jeff Rosenstock/Laura Stevenson show, since it seems they&rsquo;re all friends and stuff. As it turns out the guys from AJJ were there to play their first show as a band called Wiccan Babysitter. Their roles were reversed - the singer/guitar player was the bass player and the bass player was the singer/guitar player. That was a fun surprise, and I ended up buying a Wiccan Babysitter record. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/img_6925.jpg" alt="IMG_6925"> And Laura Stevenson was amazing as usual. (and I implore you to check out this song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-GMtVxhJd4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGxt1h-2XdY</a> - Am I crazy for thinking she should be bigger than she is? That&rsquo;s not a fat joke. Maybe guitars scare people? I need answers!) <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/img_6167.jpg" alt="IMG_6167"> And we got to talk to her for a bit after the show. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/img_7758.jpg" alt="IMG_7758"> When Jeff Rosenstock&rsquo;s band took the stage the place exploded with energy. People were jumping around and going crazy. It was a sight to behold. We were off the side as to avoid getting crushed by the unrestrained enthusiasm. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IJCPdhazNY&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IJCPdhazNY&amp;feature=youtu.be</a> Mountains making you claustrophobic and gross inversion making it hard to get oxygen in your lungs? Move to Arizona, where the sky is big, and the sunsets are large. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/img_7965.jpg" alt="IMG_7965"> And I had one of those days where you&rsquo;re traveling down the interstate and a building explodes. You know what I&rsquo;m talking about. <img src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/img_9976.jpg" alt="IMG_9976"></p>
