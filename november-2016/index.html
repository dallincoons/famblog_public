    <p>Google thought they would be clever and look for things related to &ldquo;Christmas Party&rdquo; and associate an image with it. Silly Google. <img alt="IMG_2003.PNG" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/img_20031.png"> We played Sheriff of Nottingham, which may or may not involve smuggling contraband. This guy is definitely shady. All you have to do is look at him to know that. <img alt="smuggler" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/smuggler.jpg"> I&rsquo;m not like that other guy - there&rsquo;s absolutely no contraband here. <img alt="img_2001" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/img_2001.jpg"> Emily as the &ldquo;sunbeam whisperer&rdquo;: <img alt="img_0357" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/img_0357.jpg"><img alt="img_0362" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/img_0362.jpg"> My sister Janae and her husband Mark flew down from Rexburg for Thanksgiving. We then travelled out to the middle-of-nowhere in the deserts of Southern Arizona for Thanksgiving, where we hung out on a pseudo farm thing, ate food and played with dogs. Have I mentioned that dogs are Emily&rsquo;s favourite thing ever? <img alt="img_0380" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/img_0380.jpg"> <img alt="img_0382-1" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/img_0382-1.jpg"><img alt="img_0385" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/img_0385.jpg"> That golden retriever likes to, well, retrieve things. We played a game with her by throwing a ball on the roof and she would have to anticipate where it would come down. Well, this one time, I threw the ball very poorly and it got stuck on the roof. Luckily, my brother-in-law, Mark, volunteered to get stuck up on the roof and I generously assisted. You can see the fiasco he created as people scrambled to set up the ladder. Good job, Mark, you almost ruined Thanksgiving! <img alt="img_1992" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/img_1992.jpg"> <img alt="img_1993" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/img_1993.jpg"> <img alt="img_1994" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/img_1994.jpg"> <img alt="creepy" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/creepy.jpg"> Look at these jokers.They look like this pretty much all the time. <img alt="img_0387" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/img_0387.jpg"> Emily and I have always dreamed of starting a business. So we&rsquo;re creating a product. Boom. It&rsquo;s called PepperRodeo. <img alt="img_0388" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/img_0388.jpg"> Feast your eyes on the beautiful login page. <img alt="pepperrodeologin" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/pepperrodeologin.png"> Punk rock is generally accepted to have more or less started around 1977 with the arrival of bands like the Ramones, The Clash, and the Sex Pistols. Bad Religion formed not soon after in 1979. They made a name for themselves with prominent three-part vocal harmonies, really good guitar playing, and perhaps most defining: intellectually intriguing subject matter. &ldquo;We write songs about what separates man from the animals? Is there a free will? Is there an immortal soul? What&rsquo;s the purpose of a government?&rdquo; Singer and founding member, Greg Graffin is an Anthropology professor at UCLA and Cornell University when he&rsquo;s not gigging with Bad Religion. They seem to see themselves almost as a continuation of philosophers such as Socrates, or I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;umm Kant or something (Don&rsquo;t judge me, you people who know philosophy really well). &ldquo;The pleasure in life is continuing to look for an answer, even though we recognize if it doesn&rsquo;t have an answer because it&rsquo;s actually part of human history since time immemorial that these questions have been asked and it&rsquo;s our duty to provoke them and to provoke people to think about them.&rdquo; 35 years later, they&rsquo;re playing Tempe and I&rsquo;m quite interested. Emily came along for the ride. She&rsquo;s probably not as obsessed with the genre as I am, but she &ldquo;gets it&rdquo;. We parked in some random parking lot, hoped we wouldn&rsquo;t get towed, and walked the 15-minute trek to the venue, across this lovely bridge: <img alt="img_1949" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/img_1949.jpg">. Against Me! was opening, which is a very cool band I&rsquo;m a fan of. And wow, the singer is transexual, check out how hip, cool, and inclusive I am! <img alt="img_1951" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/img_1951.jpg"> The punkest punk rocker I&rsquo;ve ever seen. <img alt="img_1957" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/img_1957.jpg"> Hiding from the authorities <img alt="img_1958" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/img_1958.jpg"> I thought punk was dead, but look at all these freaks! <img alt="img_1959" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/img_1959.jpg"> <img alt="img_1960" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/img_1960.jpg"> They&rsquo;re starting to show their age, but man can they still rock. It was a fun, fun, show.   We had a farewell dinner with our friend the Gill&rsquo;s. We met them in our first church ward when we first moved to Arizona, and we&rsquo;ve been like two peas in a pod ever since. And now they&rsquo;ve moved to Illinois so they&rsquo;re dead to us! Just kidding. Here&rsquo;s our last supper at this cool outdoor restaurant thingy: <img alt="img_1970" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/img_1970.jpg"> <img alt="img_1972" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/img_1972.jpg"> We miss our homies. That&rsquo;s all folks. Sorry if you were expecting more but there&rsquo;s no refunds and I&rsquo;m calling security.                         <img alt="img_1966" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/img_1966.jpg"></p>
