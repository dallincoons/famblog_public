    <p>Looks who&rsquo;s back! Did you miss us? You know, I&rsquo;m terrified of becoming a boring, old, low-energy 9-5 commuter who no longer finds child-like joy in the world. That&rsquo;s partially what the blog is for. It&rsquo;s one of the tools in my toolset to help keep the adventure alive. I&rsquo;ve consistently written a blog every month for the past few years. One of the qualities that I like about myself is that I generally have a lot of self-integrity: when I decide to do something, I do it. If I decide I&rsquo;m going to go to the gym every day, I go to the freaking gym every day. When I decide I&rsquo;m going to write a blog every month, that&rsquo;s what I do. The past few months however, every time I&rsquo;ve sat down to write a blog, I get an overwhelming sense of apathy. That&rsquo;s frightening to me. What&rsquo;s happening? Is this what getting old(er) feels like? Have I officially been inducted into the rat race, of which the requirements for membership are apathy and exhaustion? I don&rsquo;t want that to happen. In the words of one of my favorite bands, Andrew Jackson Jihad: <strong>I want to put on my sweatpants.</strong> <strong>But don&rsquo;t you know I&rsquo;m trying to quit.</strong> <strong>I want to give a sh** again</strong> I&rsquo;ve been acquiring vinyl records at an alarming rate! How much is too much? Should we have an intervention? <img alt="recordshop" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/recordshop-e1488742717646.jpg"> <img alt="turntable" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/turntable-e1488742618138.jpg"> Look we have friends. You can&rsquo;t tell us we don&rsquo;t have friends, we made sure to take a picture to prove it, so back off! They even do cool things like magic. <img alt="img_2332" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/img_2332.jpg"> When it&rsquo;s raining, the ONLY logical thing to do is to go get ice cream. <img alt="rainyicecream" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/rainyicecream-e1488742578151.jpg"> Phoenix/Tempe/whatever in the middle of January. Sometimes we forget heinous and depraved things such as snow exist. <img alt="tempe" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/tempe-e1488742670303.jpg"> <img alt="twochocos" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/twochocos.jpg"> I came across this picture the other day of myself and some old buddies in my preferred environment. No cars, not technology, no people - except cool people. Wow, look at those muscles! mmm mmm mmm <img alt="ountainman" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/ountainman-e1488742747891.jpg"> Do I even need to comment on this! NO <img alt="merica" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/merica-e1488742787644.jpg"> If you&rsquo;re going to live in the desert, you really should have a giant cactus in your front yard. You really should. <img alt="bigccactus" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/bigccactus-e1488742910548.jpg"> Arizona sunsets!!!!!! <img alt="azsunsets" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/azsunsets-e1488742936343.jpg"> <img alt="azsunset" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/azsunset.jpg"> California sunrise!!! <img alt="californiasunrise" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/californiasunrise.jpg"> Dogs are learning how to drive!!! <img alt="doogroof1" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/doogroof1-e1488742857785.jpg?w=3025"><img alt="doogroof" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/doogroof-e1488742883710.jpg"> Someone left us a little St. Patricks Day surprise. Thanks! But please don&rsquo;t ever do that again! Damn alcoholics&hellip; <img alt="throwup" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/throwup.jpg"> We attended the Phoenix Symphony because I thought they were playing The Planets by Gustav Holts. As it turns out they played a smattering of various spaced themed classical pieces, including Mars from The Planets. Darth Vader made an appearance to conduct the Imperial March. <img alt="darthvader" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/darthvader.jpg"> Aaand Superman. Because Superman I guess is from a different planet or something? <img alt="superman" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/superman1.jpg"> Emily&rsquo;s brother Keaton were married in March. They didn&rsquo;t want to go the same old conventional route, and so they decided to get married in In-N-Out!! Hey, why not? <img alt="marriedatinnout" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/marriedatinnout.jpg"> Here&rsquo;s the birthday boy! <img alt="lunch" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/lunch.jpg"> Look at theses smug people though, it makes me sick! <img alt="goodgroup" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/goodgroup.jpg"><img alt="ralycool" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/ralycool.jpg"> With all the love in the air, you can&rsquo;t help a couple guys getting a little carried away! <img alt="canyoufeelthelovetonight" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/canyoufeelthelovetonight1.jpg"> There&rsquo;s no excuse for these pictures! <img alt="purseman2" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/purseman2.jpg"> <img alt="weddingsarefun" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/weddingsarefun1.jpg"> Then the cops showed up. <img alt="cops" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/cops1.jpg"> With as much fun as we were having at the wedding, we never wanted it to end, but unfortunately, we had to go home :( Amazingly enough, the next week we attended a wedding for my sister Megan. They were married on the top of a mountain at Lowell Observatory under a giant telescope where they first met. Not as original as In-N-Out pretty good! <img alt="meganwedding" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/meganwedding.jpg"> People are getting married left and right! Well I&rsquo;m back in the saddle folks. See ya next month.                                   <img alt="stolesomething" src="https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/stolesomething.jpg"></p>
