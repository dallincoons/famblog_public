    <p>In March, my parents visited from Arizona. We took them to nowhere Oklahoma to eat some yummy food and go to a museum. The restaurant we were going to go to had an hour-long wait time so we settled for some yummy pizza, with which we were not disappointed at all.</p>

<p>Calvin was so nervous when he started preschool last Fall. It was heartbreaking when it was time for him to get out of the car the first day and he was clinging to Mommy and crying. It soon turned into something that he looked forward to each week, and it was a sad affair to have it end. Now he has the summer off and Pre-K to look forward to in the Fall.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, car shows are something that Calvin enjoys. Here he is getting to pick out a new car:</p>
<p><img src="calvinshopping.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>He also likes &ldquo;playing&rdquo; board games. We just make up some silly rules and he quickly gets tired of it, but also keeps requesting to do it.</p>
<p><img src="calvinboardgames.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="calvinboardgames2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And he likes to &ldquo;fix up&rdquo; actual cars.</p>
<p><img src="calvinfixingcars.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And &ldquo;garden&rdquo;:</p>
<p><img src="calvingardening1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="calvingardening2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And sit in boxes listening to stories until the sun goes down:</p>
<p><img src="calvininabox.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And go to Starbucks with Daddy:</p>
<p><img src="starbuckstradition.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And take cars offroading:</p>
<p><img src="calvinmud.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And take them to the skate park:</p>

<p>This is the Calvin show.</p>
<p><img src="calvinportrait.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>He started going to Little Kickers which is a soccer class geared towards kids his age, which he seems to like.</p>
<p><img src="littlekickers.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We traveled to southern Oklahoma to see a total solar eclipse. We stayed at a nice house with a firepit among lots of other nifty amenities.</p>
<p><img src="cookinghotdogs.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Calvin got to spend quality time with family he doesn&rsquo;t get to see in person often enough.</p>

<p><img src="staringatsun3.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And last but not least, Emily travelled to Dallas to see a band we both love, Deap Vally. It&rsquo;s their farewell tour and this would be a last time to ever get a chance to see them.</p>
